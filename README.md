# odin-recipes

This is an introductory project to HTML basis.
The project consist of making a landing page for a lasagna recipe,
with the picture of the chief.

## Steps followed:
* 1- I created index.html with the main page and I added a main navigation with links to other pages.
* 2- lasagna.html was crceated adding and existing online recipe and following instrcutions of writing ingredients needed, steps to follow and a picture of the recipe. The main navigation menu is still in this new page.
* 3- I created two more pages linked to the main page, with new existing recipes.
* 4- The project was to introduce HTML basis only, but I wanted to practice some CSS learned in previous courses, so I added style.css to all four pages.

## Considerations
* Font Awesome is used to add an icon of cutlery to make the logo. For this purpose, it is only necessary to add the link reference in the <head> part of index.html. Link reference from: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome
* CSS flexbox is used in the main page to make a horizontal display of all the recipes.
* CSS grid is employed in every recipe page to align both ingredients part and directions.
